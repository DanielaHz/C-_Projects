    - Import or read the config.txt file using std::ifstream
    - Create a vector to store the information inside the config.txt file
    - Create the shapes and check if those were sucessfull created. I think a loop can be useful
    - Center the text entitie inside the shape
    - Make that one shape can bound in the edges or sides of the window
    - make the other shapes can move around the window and bounding randomly

/*
Analysis
    -you can handled data from a file saving this in struct, classes and so on.
    The decision of which one you should to use off course depends of the requirements of the
    project, but specially about structs and classes, if you dont have to change the behavior or
    customize it form the child class structs can be more usefull.
